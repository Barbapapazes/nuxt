# Server

The ability to create within your app server endpoints is one of the new core feature of Nuxt 3. It allows you to **build full-stack application**, fetch data from your database, create a REST API or even generate static server-side content like a sitemap or a RSS feed, from a single codebase.

For more informations about usage of the `~/server` directory, please visit the [directory structure related page](/docs/guide/directory-structure/server).

## Powered by Nitro

Nuxt 3 uses [`Nitro`](https://github.com/unjs/nitro), a project from [`UnJS`](https://unjs.io), for all of his server-side stuff, along to [`Vite`](https://vitejs.dev) or [`Webpack`](https://webpack.js.org) for the client-side.

::alert{type="info"}
Note that [`Nitro`](https://github.com/unjs/nitro) is fully framework agnostic and can be used in any project, even in standalone to create a server.
::

Using [`Nitro`](https://github.com/unjs/nitro) give to Nuxt superpowers:

- Full control on the server-side part of your app
- Deploy your app anywhere
- Hybrid mode for rendering your app

## Full control on the server-side part of your app

With [`Nitro`](https://github.com/unjs/nitro), you can easily manager the server-side of your Nuxt 3 app from endpoints to middlewares.

Both endpoints and middlewares a simple as:

```ts [~/server/{routes,middleware}/index.ts]
export default defineEventHandler({
  // ... Do whatever you want here
})
```

And you can simply return `text`, `json`, `html` or even a `stream`.

Out-of-the-box, [`Nitro`](https://github.com/unjs/nitro) supports **hot module reloading** and **auto-import** like the other parts of your Nuxt 3 app.

## Deploy your app anywhere

[`Nitro`](https://github.com/unjs/nitro) offer the ability to deploy your Nuxt 3 anywhere, from a bare metal server to the edge network, with a start time near to 1ms. That's fast!

Today, [`Nitro`](https://github.com/unjs/nitro) offers more than 15 presets to build your Nuxt 3 app, for cloud provider, including:

- [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/)
- [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/)
- [Vercel Edge Network](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/introduction)
- [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
- [IIS](https://www.iis.net/)

Or for other runtime:

- [Deno](https://deno.land/)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)

## Hybrid mode for rendering your app

Need for both static and dynamic pages in your Nuxt 3 app? [`Nitro`](https://github.com) covers your back!

Nitro has a powerful feature called `routeRules` which allow you to define a set of rules to customize the rendering mode of all your routes, client and server from your Nuxt 3 app.

```ts [~/nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  routeRules: {
    '/': { prerender: true }, // Generated at build time for SEO purpose
    '/api/*': { cache: { maxAge: 60 * 60 } } // Cached for 1 hour
    '/old-page': { redirect: { to: { '/new-page', status: 302 } } // Redirection to avoid 404
    // ...
  }
})
```

[More rules are available](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/rendering#hybrid-rendering) to customize the rendering mode of your routes.

[`Nitro`](https://github.com/unjs/nitro) is also used to generate your Nuxt 3 app when using the [`generate` command](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/commands/generate) and the server when building the app for runtime server side rendering.
