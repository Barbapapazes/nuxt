# Server

Nuxt's server framework allows you to build **full-stack applications**. For example, you can fetch data from a database or another server, create an API or even generate static server-side content like a sitemap or an RSS feed - all from a single codebase.

For more informations about usage of the `~/server` directory, please visit the [server directory structure section](/docs/guide/directory-structure/server).

## Powered by Nitro

Nuxt 3 server-side features are powered by [unjs/nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io/), while the client-side features are powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) or [webpack](https://webpack.js.org).

::alert{type="info"}
Note that Nitro is framework agnostic and can be used without Nuxt.

Using Nitro give Nuxt superpowers:

- Full control of the server-side part of your app
- Deploy your app anywhere
- Hybrid rendering for your app

## Full control of the server-side part of your app

With Nitro, you can easily manage the server-side of your Nuxt 3 app; from endpoints to middleware.

Both endpoints and middleware can be defined like this:

```ts [server/api/test.ts]
export default defineEventHandler({
  // ... Do whatever you want here
})
```

And you can directly return `text`, `json`, `html` or even a `stream`.

Out-of-the-box, Nitro supports **hot module replacement** and **auto-import** like the other parts of your Nuxt application.

## Deploy your app anywhere

Nitro offers the ability to deploy your Nuxt 3 anywhere, from a bare metal server to the edge network, with a start time near to a few milliseconds. That's fast!

Today, Nitro offers more than 15 presets to build your Nuxt 3 app for different cloud providers and servers, including:

- [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/)
- [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/)
- [Vercel Edge Network](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/introduction)
- [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
- [IIS](https://www.iis.net/)

Or for other runtime:

- [Deno](https://deno.land/)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)

## Hybrid rendering for your app

Need for both static and dynamic pages in your Nuxt 3 app? Nitro covers your back!

Nitro has a powerful feature called `routeRules` which allow you to define a set of rules to customize the routes rendering mode of your Nuxt 3 app.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  routeRules: {
    '/': { prerender: true }, // Generated at build time for SEO purpose
    '/api/*': { cache: { maxAge: 60 * 60 } } // Cached for 1 hour
    '/old-page': { redirect: { to: { '/new-page', status: 302 } } // Redirection to avoid 404
    // ...
  }
})
```

[More rules are available](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/rendering#hybrid-rendering) to customize the rendering mode of your routes.

Nitro is used to build the app for server side rendering, as well as pre-rendering.
